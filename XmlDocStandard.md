## SDK XML documentation standard text:
### Note/Questions:
1. Async void return type such as `Task` does not need to be documented
2. One class per file unless same named generic and non-generic

### Return

* For sync and async of same operations, the description should be the same. There is no need to call out sync's blocking nature.
* The async return should starts with `A <see cref="Task"/> that on completion returns ` and followed by text for sync version.
* For methods returning LRO (typically `StartXXX`), add following in remarks section.

```
        /// <remarks>
        /// <see href="https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-longrunning"> Details on long running operation object. </see>
        /// </remarks>
```
